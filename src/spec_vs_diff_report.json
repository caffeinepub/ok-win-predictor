The backend Prediction type now includes a predictedNumber field (0-9), the frontend displays the predicted number prominently in both the PredictionDisplay and PredictionHistory components with appropriate color-coding (green for odd, red for even), and the number is properly integrated into the automatic prediction generation flow.",
